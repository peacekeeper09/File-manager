# File Manager


This is my hooby project so don't really mind it or start to judge anything. File Manager is a basic PyQt5-based desktop application that allows users to browse and manage their files and directories with a user-friendly interface. It provides essential file operations such as opening files, deleting files, renaming files/directories, creating new folders, and viewing file properties. The application is designed to be responsive and easy to use.
